      meetup and those who can't attend anyâ€”and everyone in between.</p>

      <p className="tab-content__details">Many local developers don't have
      time to attend meetups, simply can't go as often as they'd like to, or
      live too far away from ones they would like to attend. For these
      reasons, we created this community so more developers can network with
      each other. This community is less formal than the various Meetup
      groups, and we don't (yet) have any regular meetings. It's more just a
      place to gather and chat, collaborate, get help, offer help, advice,
      network, etc. Join us and meet more devs!</p>
